# Unknown-face-recognition

Face recognition is a method of identifying or naming individuals/group using the features extracted from face. As an output of face recognition, a bounding box is drawn on the face and the name of the face is displayed. Face recognition is widely used in many applications like biometric, surveillence etc. But one of the main problem in face recognition is the poor performance in recognizing unknown faces. Unknown faces are the faces that are not used either in training or testing. Most cases, the trianed face recognition model, recognizes an unknown person as one of the trained faces. To overcome this issue, Openset classification approach is followed.

## How to use ?
